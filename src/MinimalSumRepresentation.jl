    # numbers that you could sum together and go through
    # the possibilities from that collection, and increment
    # the number of digits until we find a match.
    #
    # This is the most na√Øve solution and the least, but it
    # would find you other possible solutions with a slight
    # modification.
    #
    # You could do something more clever with choosing the
    # number of digits you're looking at from the start; e.g.,
    #
    #     mod1(target, 9).
    #
    # The reality is that if the number is greater than the
    # largest single digit (9), then we will just choose 9
    # until we find the remainder we need:
    #

    # But this is uninteresting, and renders the whole repo
    # useless!
